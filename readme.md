# AI Assisted Document Assembly

This is a proof of concept document assembly tool.  Instead of meticulously drafting paragraphs that can interoperate whether pieces are missing or not, or if the order is changed, we can use sloppy drafting and ask AI to reconstruct a coherent letter.

The result is a basic document assembly tool done that can be deployed on a static website, with calls to OpenAI after the fact to fix the letter.  Both the content and the prompt are placeholders.

The sample comes from the New York Depart of State: https://dos.ny.gov/data-security-breach-notification-sample-letter.
